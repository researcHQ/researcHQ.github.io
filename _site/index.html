<p>ResearcHQ.org provides the civic sector access to trustworthy academic partners to 
increase timely, relevant, and cost-effective research that can readily improve society.</p>

<p>Specific goals include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide <strong>practitioners</strong> with timely, relevant, and trustworthy 
  answers to questions they have at a reduced cost</li>
  <li>help <strong>researchers</strong> make their research more relevant and useful while 
increasing their access to funding</li>
  <li>lower the transaction cost to funding researchers by greasing the wheels of 
contracting and dealing with IP issues</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Civic sector research dollars are not effectively leading to better societal investments 
and decision-making because of: </p>

<ol>
  <li>little to no direct access and knowledge sharing between researchers and 
people who would use the research;  </li>
  <li>high transaction costs (time, money, legal expertise) to execute an 
agreement with academia; and  </li>
  <li>time it takes for federal research priorities to be updated and 
then funding trickle down.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Some of the symptoms of these problems include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Academics, forced to follow the money, are researching problems that may not relevant 
to today’s needs or are spending an exceptional amount of time fundraising;</li>
  <li>Little to no funding for new and emerging issues (e.g., the impact on the civic sector 
of Uber/Lyft, safety issues between bikes and transit);</li>
  <li>Agencies with large research budgets are confronted with situations where it can
cost more money to spend their required research set-aside than leave it untouched; and</li>
  <li>Precious staff time and budget gets spent on contract negotiations.</li>
</ul>

<p>This results in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decisions in government and society that can be more easily influenced by money and 
politics rather than fact;  </li>
  <li>unspent money already allocated to research; </li>
  <li>ineffective, unsafe, and outdated policies and practices; and  </li>
  <li>fewer incentives for bright young professionals to enter the civic space.  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="associated-problems">Associated Problems</h4>

<p>There are number of adjunct problems to the one we are currently trying to tacke directly.
They are significant enough issues that we cannot ignore them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Competitive rather than collaborative academic environments that incentivize “winning”
the research goal (publishing first) rather than coming up with the best solution for 
society in an expedient and timely manner.</li>
  <li>Dissemination of in-progress research information (related to above).</li>
  <li>Academic reward structure that emphasizes publication of novel ideas rather than development
of those ideas into something that can be implemented practically.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last of these issues is especially acute in the civic-sector.  In the private-sector
there is a profit motivation to implement research and take it the last mile.  However, 
the civic sector is not set up to develop the last-mile research itself and thus this task
most often rests with academia. </p>

<h2 id="the-current-thinking-on-a-solution">The [current thinking on a] Solution</h2>

<p>A two-way matching marketplace to help researchers find funders who will help provide 
needed resources, data, and advice and help funders find collaborators and 
researchers to execute the research. The solution has the following components:</p>

<p><strong>Front-End</strong>
An online forum for discussing, collaborating, and proposing research.
Online vehicle for posting a research question with funding.
A subscription service that pings you when research you might be interested in gets funded or proposed.
Quick turn-around statement of interest from interested academics.
Yelp-like rating system for academics so that funders can trust what they are buying.
Clickable contracting mechanism to begin work.
Deliverables and payment interchange.</p>

<p><strong>Behind the Scenes</strong>
Master contract agreements with universities that enable quick contracting turn-around.
Insurance via ResearcHQ.org.</p>

<p>Think of it as a 99Designs + kickstarter + task rabbit for trustworthy academic research.</p>

<h4 id="impact">Impact</h4>

<p>We have identified the following goals for impact and are committed to measuring them:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reduce transaction costs for research for civic good by over 25%, which would 
potentially save $5m of philanthropic funding and $100m in government funding per year.</li>
  <li>Increase the number of the 4.1 million graduate students in the U.S. who receive 
research funding, particularly for applied research on civic and social impact issues. 
A simple reinvestment of the savings would result in 2,000 more students receiving full 
funding for socially important research and tuition per year rather than driving them to 
industry-subsidized research areas.</li>
  <li>Decrease the turn-around time between research needs identification and policy-ready 
answers from approximately 5-10 years to 1-2 years, which will save governments millions 
of dollars in implementing less efficient solutions.</li>
  <li>Increased research partnerships and better matchmaking between researchers and 
practitioners will make each research dollar more effective and relevant.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="market-analysis">Market Analysis</h4>

<p>We use research dollars that are spent for the public 
good that are under $500,000 per grant (more than that, and a one-on-one negotiation may 
make sense) as a market benchmark.  There are two main sources for socially impact 
related research funding: philanthropy and government.</p>

<p>Currently there is a $1-3 billion/year market for applied research
transactions under $500,000: </p>

<ul>
  <li>&lt;$1 billion from philanthropy (source: Foundation Center’s analysis of
2013 990-PFs) and </li>
  <li>$1-2 billion from government research funds (source: AAAS).</li>
</ul>

<p>To our knowledge, this is a unique solution and product to meet a need that no other 
entity is addressing.  Consultations with the National Academies of Science, government 
employees at various levels, and a variety of Tier I research institutions have indicated
 that they would consider this an innovative and  supportive activity to meet an unmet need.</p>

<p>Our market analysis has not revealed another institution addressing the market need for
 matching researchers, research needs and funding.  There are quite a few similar 
 for-profit expert marketplaces such as 99designs and toptal.com.  There are also quite
 a few universities who have tried to crowdfund specific research projects from Alumni
 using the tool ScaleFunder.  None of these solution currently meet the market need
 we have identified.</p>

<h2 id="team">Team</h2>

<p>ResearcHQ.org team is led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/elizabeth-sall/1/a85/207">Elizabeth Sall</a>, 
the former Deputy Director for Technology, Data, and Analysis at the 
<a href="www.sfcta.org/modeling">S.F. County Transportation Authority (SFCTA)</a>.  Elizabeth decided 
to start ResearcHQ.org after being consistently frustrated by the difficulties 
of executing small contracts with Academic institutions while working in governemnt.  </p>

<p>Elizabeth has experience and network in multiple sectors: government, non-profit, 
and academic.  She hold several appointments to committees of the Transportation 
Research Board, served on the department-level advisory board at her alma-mater 
N.C. State University, and is a frequent lecturer at universities.  Elizabeth is a 
frequent presenter and organizer of civic technology conferences, pioneered an academic 
research program at the SFCTA and continues to lead government-funded research projects 
with cross-sector teams.  In the non-profit sector, she has experience as both a funder 
and oversight board-member in working with academic researchers.</p>

<p>After multiple rounds of feedback from various academic and government stakeholders, 
the initial ResearcHQ.org board is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=11060042">Elizabeth Bent</a></strong>, a principal at
