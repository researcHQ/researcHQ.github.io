		<h3>
		What is this?
		</h3>

		<p>
		The mission of researcHQ.org is to get useful research funded by matching funding 
		controlled by those who will use the research with promising researchers.

		<p>Specific goals include:

		<ul>
			<li>
				provide <em>practitioners</em> with timely, relevant, and trustworthy 
				answers to questions they have at a reduced cost
			</li>
			<li>
				help <em>researchers</em> make their research more relevant and useful while 
				increasing their access to funding
			</li>
			<li>
				lower the transaction cost to funding researchers by greasing the wheels of 
				contracting and dealing with IP issues
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>
		The Problem
		</h3>

		<p>
			Research currently gets initiated in a multitude of ways, most of which are 
			financially inefficient and dilute the relevance of the work.
		<p>
			Major corporations and foundations commonly sponsor external research (not even 
			to mention the multitude of internal research) that helps them create a better 
			product or work towards solving a particular issue.  However, the transaction 
			cost for sponsoring research is often so great that this only makes sense for 
			major bucks projects, which <em>limits access</em> to research except to huge 
			enterprises.
		<p>
			Government sponsored research is supposed to fill in the gap.  However, decisions 
			about how to spend government funded research <em>start at congress</em>, limiting 
			its relevancy and flexibility to deal with current issues at hand.  It is also 
			financially inefficient, as it has to pass down through several layers of bureaucracy 
			before finally landing in the bank of an actual researcher.  Don't get me wrong - 
			great things have been done with government sponsored research, but it is not an 
			efficient process.

<p>
	So what if I am a small business, foundation, contractor, or government agency?  
</p>

<p>
	How do <em>your research needs</em> get satisfied?
</p>

<p>
	Well there are a few ways, all chancy.  Let's pretend you are working for a 
	local transportation agency and want to know something like how much parallel 
	parking slows down a bus running in an adjacent lane.  You can:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
	half-ass the research yourself with whatever leftover time you have.  
	Have aspirations to publish the research, but five years go by and you 
	haven't had time yet so you figure nobody cares anymore. 
</li>
<li>
	lobby your State DOT to ask for research project overseen by the National 
	Academy of Sciences, and four-to-five years later you will have a watered-down 
	report written by competent, although cubby-holed, consultants and overseen by 
	a staff person that doesn't have on-the-ground experience 
</li>
<li>
	hang out at your local university, take some grad students out for beers, 
	take their advisor out for coffee, spend a year trying to work through IP 
	and contracting issues, befriend new batch of grad students (the previous 
	ones have graduated) and hope they have the same skill set, and then start 
	your research.
</li>
<li>
	have beers with a couple of buddies at other local agencies, realize you all 
	have the same questions.  Find money at each of our respective institutions 
	to spend on answering the question.  Find a non-profit to "hold" the pooled 
	money and hire a consultant.  Circulate an MOA.  Circulate it again with edits 
	from 3rd agency.  A year later, issue an RFP that conforms to each agency's 
	procurement standards.  Hire consultant.  Find more money.  Circulate MOA again.
	  Start work. Realize that what you are working on is no longer relevant.
</li>
<li>
	have cocktails with professor, have co-workers shower professor with compliments 
	about the relevancy of his research, he offers you the perfect grad student to take 
	up residence in your office for the summer. For free. It's cheap, it's relevant, 
	it's awesome.  It's also extremely unlikely.
</li>
</ol>

<p>	
All of these has happened to me.  By far, the last one is the most preferable, but it 
is also extremely rare and presumes that you happen to have cocktails with the right 
professor at the right time with the right funding situation to make it happen.
</p>

<p>
	Most of the options characterized above suffer from one of the following issues:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>little to no direct access between researchers and people who would use the research, which leads to decreased relevancy and timeliness of research</li>
  <li>intolerable administrative burden relative to the size of the questions</li>
  <li>few opportunities to collaboratively develop a flexible research agenda</li>
</ul>


		<h3>
		The [current thinking on a] Solution
		</h3>

		<p>
		The current thinking of the activities of researcHQ.org is to take the aspects 
		of "what works" from the above examples, and lessen the hurt of the parts that 
		are painful (costs, contracting). While it is beyond clichéd to discuss your 
		solution as a combination of two already popular tech solutions, here goes – 
		it’s like Kickstarter/GlobalGiving meets Task Rabbit/eLance.   A two-way 
		matching marketplace to help researchers find funders who will help provide 
		needed resources, data, and advice and help funders find collaborators and 
		researchers to execute the research. 
		</p>

		<h3>
		Who What Where?
		</h3>

		<p>
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=5649127">Elizabeth Sall</a> is
		 the recent Deputy Director for Technology Services for the 
		 <a href="http://www.sfcta.org/modeling-and-travel-forecasting">San Francisco 
		 County Transportation Authority</a> and current free thinker and do-er. 
		 She has been wanting to embark on this effort for a while and is glad to finally 
		 has some time to devote to it.
